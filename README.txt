Design pattern is defined as well described solution to a common software problem.

Some of the benefits of using design patterns are :

1. Design patterns are already defined and provides industry standard approach to solve recurring problem,
   so it saves time if we sensibly use the design pattern. There are many java design patterns that we can
   use in our java based projects.

2. Using design patterns  promotes re-usability that leads to most robust and highly maintainable code.

3. Since design patterns are already defined, it makes out code easy to understand and debug. It leads to
   faster development and new members of team understand it easily.

 Java design patterns are divide into three categories - creational, structural and behavioral design patterns.

 . Creational Design Patterns
        . Singleton Pattern
        . Factory Pattern
        . Abstract Factory Pattern
        . Builder Pattern
        . Prototype Pattern

 . Structural Design Patterns
        . Adapter Pattern
        . Composite Pattern
        . Proxy Pattern
        . Flyweight Pattern
        . Facade Pattern
        . Bridge Pattern
        . Decorator Pattern

 . Behavioral Design Patterns
        . Template Method Pattern
        . Mediator Pattern
        . Chain of Responsibility Pattern
        . Observer Pattern
        . Strategy Pattern
        . Command Pattern
        . State Pattern
        . Visitor Pattern
        . Interpreter Pattern
        . Iterator Pattern
        . Memento Pattern

 Creational Design Patterns
 Creational desing patterns provide solution to instantiate a object in best possible way for specific situations.

Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns provide different ways to create class structure, for example using inheritance and
composition to create a large object from small objects.

Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral Patterns provide solutino for better interaction between objects and how to provide lose
coupling and flexibility to extend easily.
